Brief overview of the dashboard:
This dashboard provides a consolidated view of sales and profit performance across cities, product categories, and customer segments.
City-level insights:
A heatmap shows order volumes by city and day of the week, while the map highlights city-wise profits, indicating which cities are profitable and which are incurring losses.
Product performance:
Bar charts display product-wise profits and top-selling product categories, helping identify the strongest and weakest product lines.
Customer segmentation:
Donut charts break down sales distribution across Consumer, Corporate, Small Business, and Home Office segments for Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology.
Overall KPIs:
Key metrics include total sales (£1.92M), total orders (1365), returned orders (11), and a low return rate (0.81%).
Trend analysis:
A sales/profit timeline tracks performance over time, revealing fluctuations and spikes in profitability.
In short: the dashboard gives a quick, high-level understanding of where sales are coming from, which products and cities perform best, customer behavior, and overall business health.
